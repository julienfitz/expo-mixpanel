# expo-mixpanel-http

A library for interacting with the Mixpanel HTTP API in Expo projects. Mixpanel provides many great SDKs, but currently not one that can be easily used with Expo.

To install:

`npm install expo-mixpanel-http`

or

`yarn add expo-mixpanel-http`

TODO:
- expand README with detailed information about how to use this library and why.
- address more types of Mixpanel events than those currently addressed.
- possibly extract interactions with Mixpanel HTTP API to be separate from Expo-specific interactions so the library can be used more generically.
